### Reflection

Based on the current state of our app, we have implemented the functions for all job stories and this is a strong foundation for this dashboard. Further contributions and edits will be made over the next couple of milestones to ensure all job stories are appropriately considered and fulfilled. Currently, we have major components for each job story and optional filters as well.
